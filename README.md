Welcome to the Tortuga Rover Operation Instructions:


Step 1 - Verify that you have all of the need robot components:
You will require the following:
	- This laptop (Verify that the laptop is charged)
	- The Tortuga Rover
	- The rover tether
	- Small Blue Battery with velcro (Make sure that the battery is charged)
	- Any backup battery pack (Make sure that the battery is charged)

Step 2 - Put the Small Blue Battery pack onto the top of the robot.

Step 3 - Unravel the tether and connect it to the robot and the laptop:
	- The end of the tether that unwraps is the end that connects to the robot.
	- Connect the ethernet cable to the ethernet port on the robot's Raspberry Pi (Found in the back)
	- Connect the rope loop onto both the D-Clips on the back of the robot
	- Connect the white cable to the female cable on the Small Blue Battery
		(Make sure that it doesn't interfere with the treads)
	- Connect the other end of the ethernet cable to the laptop
	- Connect a back up battery to the female end of the white cable. Make sure to turn on the battery.

Step 5 - Run the Turtle_Robot Controller Script. Multiple windows will open with this step. 
	- Wait until the grey controller screen appears.
	- If done properly, you will hear the robot beep for 1 second. 
		This means that the robot is running properly.
	- If the robot doesn't beep, close the controller and all python tabs and run the script again

Step 6 - Click the connect button then the open video button:
	- You should see a live recording from the robot. If not, repeat step 5 again.
